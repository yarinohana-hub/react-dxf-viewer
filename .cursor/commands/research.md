# /research - Enter RESEARCH Mode

## Command
`/research` or `ENTER RESEARCH MODE`

## Purpose
Information gathering and understanding existing code, systems, and requirements.

## When to Use
- At the beginning of a new feature or bugfix
- When encountering unfamiliar code or systems
- When you need to understand how something works
- Before making any significant changes to existing code

## What It Does
1. **Switches Mode**: Changes RIPER_CURRENT_MODE to "RESEARCH"
2. **Focuses on Analysis**: Prioritizes understanding over implementation
3. **Gathers Information**: Analyzes code, documentation, and system behavior

## Research Activities
- **Code Analysis**: Deep dive into existing implementations
- **System Mapping**: Understanding data flows and dependencies
- **Documentation Review**: Analyzing existing documentation and comments
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying architectural patterns and conventions
- **Dependency Analysis**: Understanding how components interact

## Best Practices
1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what you want to understand
2. **Provide Context**: @-mention relevant files or components
3. **Ask Follow-ups**: Deepen understanding with targeted questions
4. **Document Findings**: Key discoveries should be noted for future reference
5. **Stay Focused**: Avoid implementation ideas during research

## Example Prompts
```
"I need to understand how the authentication system works."
"Can you analyze the data flow in the payment processing module?"
"Help me understand the existing implementation of the shopping cart."
"What are the current patterns for error handling in this codebase?"
```

## Typical Research Outputs
- System architecture understanding
- Component interaction diagrams
- Code pattern documentation
- Dependency maps
- Current state analysis

## Next Steps
After thorough research, typically transition to:
- **INNOVATE Mode** - To brainstorm potential approaches
- **PLAN Mode** - If the solution is clear and needs detailed planning
